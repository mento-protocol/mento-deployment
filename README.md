# Mento Deployment

This repo contains scripts for deploying & proposing upgrades to the Mento protocol.
Deployments for the core contracts are done usingÂ [Foundry solidity scripting](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting).

## Getting Started

```bash
# Get the latest code
git clone git@github.com:mento-protocol/mento-deployment.git

# Change directory to the the newly cloned repo
cd mento-deployment

# Install the project dependencies & build the contracts
forge install && forge build

# Create your .env file (Replace the PK for deployer account)
cp .env.example .env

# Pull secrets from GCP
yarn secrets:get

# Execute scripts using forge script command
forge script DeployCircuitBreaker --rpc-url $BAKLAVA_RPC_URL --broadcast --legacy --verify --verifier sourcify
```

## Deployment Structure

The deployment scripts are organized in the following structure:
- `contracts/`: Contains helper contracts that aren't core, for example a DummyERC20 contract used on testnets
- `scripts/`: Contains all the Foundry deployment scripts
  - `scripts/upgrade/`: Contains all the upgrade scripts, which serve as a migration from one version of mento to another 
    - `scripts/upgrade/MU01/`: Contains all the upgrade scripts to migrate from version v1.0.0. to v2.0.0
  - `scripts/dev/`: Contains dev scripts that are used in the deployment process, especially on testnets, but aren't central to the upgrade.
  - `scripts/utils/`: Contains helpers and utilities used in the deployment process.
- `bin/`: Contains bash/typescript scripts that are used to execute the deployment process.
- `broadcast/`: Contains the broadcasted transactions for the deployment process.

## Scripts

The scripts tend to follow a similar structure, and are either simple helpers or wrappers for the `forge script` command.

General options will include:
- `-n`: The network to run on, e.g. `baklava` or `alfajores`
- `-u`: The upgrade number, e.g. `MU01`

Check the script file for more details on usage but here's a quick overview:

```bash
# Clean the broadcast folder, will remove all broadcast files pertaining to that network and upgrade combination
> yarn clean -n baklava -u MU01 

# Show the list of deployed contracts and their addresses
> yarn show -n baklava -n MU01
