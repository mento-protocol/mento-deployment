### FX01

This proposal introduces four new stable tokens pegged to major fiat currencies: British Pound (cGBP), South African Rand (cZAR), Canadian Dollar (cCAD), and Australian Dollar (cAUD).

Deployment scripts:

- FX01-00-Create-Proxies.sol: Creates proxy contracts for each new stable token (cGBP, cZAR, cCAD, cAUD)
- Transfers ownership of these proxies to Celo Governance

Proposal Summary:

- Initializes four new stable tokens (cGBP, cZAR, cCAD, cAUD) with appropriate names and symbols
- Configures constitution parameters for each token
- Adds each token to the Reserve
- Enables gas payments with each token using the new FeeCurrencyDirectory
- Creates exchange pools for each token paired with cUSD
- Configures trading limits for each pool
- Sets up circuit breakers (MedianDeltaBreaker) for each token's rate feed

Note: This proposal does not modify the Mento protocol itself, but rather extends it by adding new stable tokens for foreign exchange (FX) purposes, hence the name "FX01".
