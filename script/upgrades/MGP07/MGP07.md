## TL;DR

This proposal unpauses the Mento Token, enabling normal token transfers for all users. Initially launched as a non-transferable governance token, the MENTO token was designed with a future option to become transferable contingent upon the protocolâ€™s maturity, as well as community and market readiness. Given Mento's significant progress, product traction, and strategic focus on stablecoin-based onchain FX markets, enabling token transferability is now timely and beneficial for the protocol's continued growth and decentralization.

### Motivation

Activating MENTO token transferability is expected to:

- **enhance liquidity and accessibility**, enabling a wider and more diverse group of stakeholders to actively participate in Mento governance;
- **facilitate deeper decentralization** by incentivizing and empowering new contributors, further distributing governance influence across the community;
- **strengthen the protocol's resilience and community ownership** by further decentralizing token holdings;
- **align token utility with current market expectations**, working towards tangible economic incentives that drive innovation, active participation, and strategic collaborations within the broader decentralized finance ecosystem.

### Rationale

Mento has reached significant milestones demonstrating the community's readiness for token transferability:

- **Mento decentralized local currency stablecoins** are among the growing stablecoins in the industry with 15 local stablecoins live, that include all G7s and key African, LatAm, and South East Asian currencies
- **The Mento Asset Exchange**, integrated into leading solutions like Squid Router or Opera MiniPay, processed over 550 million transactions in 2024
- **Mento has over 8m users** with around 400k daily active users and strategic partnerships with major global organizations, including Deutsche Telekom, Opera, Chainlink, RedStone, Valora, Fonbnk, Yellow Card, and many more
- **MENTO is about to unlock the next stage of growth** with onchain FX trading
