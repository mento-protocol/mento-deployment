### FX03

This proposal introduces three new stable tokens pegged to major fiat currencies: Swiss Franc (cCHF), Nigerian Naira (cNGN) and Japanese Yen (cJPY).

Proposal Summary:

- Initializes three new stable tokens (cCHF, cNGN, cJPY) with appropriate names and symbols
- Configures constitution parameters for each token
- Adds each token to the Reserve
- Enables gas payments with each token using the new FeeCurrencyDirectory
- Creates exchange pools for each token paired with cUSD
- Configures trading limits for each pool
- Sets up circuit breakers (MedianDeltaBreaker) for each token's rate feed

Note: This proposal does not modify the Mento protocol itself, but rather extends it by adding new stable tokens for foreign exchange (FX) purposes, hence the name "FX03".
